## Reporting a Vulnerability

If you discover a vulnerability in our project, please report it following these steps:

1. **Report Submission**: Vulnerability reports can be submitted via direct message to the repository admins on GitHub.

2. **Expected Response Time**: You can expect an acknowledgment of your report within 48 hours. We aim to provide updates on the status of the report every 1-2 weeks, but the frequency may vary based on the complexity of the issue.

3. **Assessment Process**: Once a report is received, our security team will assess the severity and impact of the vulnerability. We will categorize it based on our assessment and determine the appropriate action.

4. **Disclosure Policy**:
   - If the vulnerability is confirmed, we will provide a timeline for when the fix will be released and any necessary updates.
   - If the vulnerability is declined (for example, if it's found to be a non-issue or not applicable), we will inform you of our reasoning.

5. **Confidentiality**: Please refrain from publicly disclosing any vulnerabilities until they have been resolved and a public announcement has been made. We appreciate your cooperation in keeping our community safe.

### Note:
- Write access to the repository is restricted to admins only. Users can fork the repository, star it, and create pull requests to contribute. All contributions will be reviewed by the admin team.
